      <img src='' alt="AidenMinerve2" />

      <p>
      My tech journey began during the summer of 2022 where I worked at a STEM summer camp where we recreated old school video games like Pong and Snake using Javascript. My interest grew from there. I then enrolled myself into a rigorous 15 week boot camp where I learned front end and back end web development as well as languages such as HTML5, CSS and React . While I was in that program I structured and designed multiple apps which you can find on my Github. I have since continued to improve on the skills that I do have while constantly feeding my brain new concepts and growing as a Software Engineer.

        <h1>What I've Learned</h1>

        <ul>
          <li><span className="bold">The more I know, the more I realize I know nothing.</span> Sounds cliche but this couldn't apply more to me (and i'm sure many others) and the never ending expedition of learning the ins and outs of the various frameworks and languages.</li>
          <li><span className="bold">Don’t be afraid to ask questions.</span> Whether you end up taking the school route or the bootcamp route, questions are essential and can be the difference between you excelling or falling behind. No question is a bad question and you’ll realize that others may have also had the same question as you.  Don’t suffer in silence.</li>
          <li><span className="bold">It’s a Marathon not a sprint.</span> Learning isn’t linear and everyone grows at their own pace. There were times where I didn’t understand something as fast as others or was stuck on a specific error; but all in all; it is better to take a little bit longer to fully understand something than to rush to the next topic with a weak grasp.</li>
          <li><span className="bold">Listen to Learn.</span> Especially in enviroments where there are people more experienced and knowledgeble than you, it is essential to open your ears and take in what they know. “A smart person learns from his mistakes, but a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others.” By learning from their mistakes and experiences, you can avoid pitfalls and focus on effective strategies, saving time and trouble in the long run and instead focus on the most effective strategies.</li>
